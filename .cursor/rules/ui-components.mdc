# UI Component Guidelines

## Shadcn Components
- Always use shadcn components when available instead of creating custom components
- To add a new shadcn component, run: `npx shadcn@latest add [component-name]`
- Example: `npx shadcn@latest add card` for card components

## Component Usage
- Import shadcn components from their respective directories
- Do not recreate components that already exist in shadcn
- Custom components should only be created for unique UI requirements not covered by shadcn

## Best Practices
- Maintain consistent styling by using shadcn's design system
- Follow shadcn's documentation for proper component implementation
- Ensure proper TypeScript types are used with shadcn components
